    Over four years as a quantitative analyst - <em>quant</em> for short - I have worked on structured rate derivatives, inflation options, equity hybrids and commodity modeling for two British investment banks.
    As an example, I helped address many of the modelling implications - in the world of interest rate options -  of an industry shift from LIBOR term rates to compounded overnight Risk-Free Reference (RFR) rates.
    There are many fascinating problems to solve and tools to develop in financial mathematics.
