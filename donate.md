    Over the course of four years as a quantitative analyst - <em>quant</em> for short - I have worked on structured rate derivatives, inflation options, equity hybrids and commodity modeling for two British investment banks.
    As an example, I have worked on the LIBOR transition, addressing the modelling implications for interest rate options of an industry shift from LIBOR term rates to compounded overnight Risk-Free Reference (RFR) rates.
    There are many fascinating problems to solve and tools to develop in financial mathematics, using stochastic calculus and a variety numerical methods.
