      I am set to return to Nepal to spend three weeks in the Annapurna region. One year ago I found myself in bewildered awe at the country's landscapes and breathtaking views, the unfailingly warm welcome one gets everywhere one goes, and the positive non-chalance of the Nepalis, and therefore hastily made plans to return the following year. This time I hope to complete a self-designed eighteen day circuit that includes Mardi Himal, Annapurna Base Camp, and Poon Hill.

      At its best, walking grants access to spots of unique beauty while simultaneously drawing us back into the uninhabited spaces that lie in between. There is something for everbody, whether that is an accessible form of exercise, a deliberate act of delayed gratification, a chance for extended self-reflexion and quiet contemplation, or an opportunity to share long and invariably deep conversations with fellow walkers. I hope this webpage and the articles below can become an ode to walking for walking's sake, and a thinly veiled attempt to encourage interested readers to embark on their own strolls, pilgrimages or expeditions.

      The Great Himalaya Trail is a network of trails that span the entire length of Nepal, and consequently much of the Himalayas. 
      (Elaborate on your plan to walk the length of Nepal over six months, between September 2023 and June 2024.)
