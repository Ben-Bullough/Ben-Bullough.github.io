    Over the course of four years as a quantitative analyst - <em>quant</em> for short - I have worked on structured rate derivatives, inflation options, equity hybrids and commodity modeling for two British investment banks.
    As an example, I have worked on the LIBOR transition, addressing the modelling implications for interest rate options of an industry shift from LIBOR term rates to compounded overnight Risk-Free Reference (RFR) rates.
    There are many fascinating problems to solve and tools to develop in financial mathematics, using stochastic calculus and a variety numerical methods.

    <p class="text-gray text-center"> I hold an MSc in Pure Mathematics from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a> (ICL), where I took courses in commutative and homologiclal algebra, elliptic curves and Lie algebras.
      My masters' dissertation starts with the Grothendieck group, constructed from the abelian monoid of quadratic forms, and builds towards a proof of Pfister's Local-Global Principle using Lewis polynomials. 
      It is entitled "Pfister's local-global principle and the <em>u</em>-invariant of formally real fields" and can be found below!
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray text-center"> Between 2015 and 2018 I studied Mathematics and Economics at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk" target="_blank">London School of Economics and Political Science</a> (LSE), taking courses in pure mathematics, econometric theory, probability theory and financial mathematics.
